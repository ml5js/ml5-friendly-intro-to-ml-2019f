## TLDR

* This is an introductory workshop to machine learning with ml5.js
* Context/Audience: prepared for Golan Levin's [Interactivity and Computation](http://cmuems.com/2019/60212/) at CMU. Students in this course are are creative tech folks or creative tech adjacent and are considered "intromediates" -- "*students develop the skills and confidence to produce interactive artworks, discuss their work in relation to current and historic praxes of digital art, and engage new technologies critically*." -- but we hope this workshop can be used with audiences of all shapes and types.
* General overview of machine learning concepts and terms with emphasis on learning through making.
* We use ml5.js, a javascript library to do machine learning for the web.

## Key Questions and Takeaways

> This is an introductory workshop to machine learning. We are focused on helping you to not only *learn through making* but also start to *reflect through making*. The following questions are here to help focus the **learning** and **reflecting**. 

+ What is ml5.js?
+ What is the relationship between ml5 and tensorflow.js?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is possible? and why is this amazing?
+ Why machine learning in the browser is important also for democratizing machine learning?
+ Why we need to be able to “poke” at machine learning as creatives - to see how the implications of “state of the art” impact people differently?


## The AI/ML universe

> AI/ML isn't just about advancements in technology, it is about a broader universe of things that are coming together (or diverging). These include changes (or lackthereof) in governance, cultural and social interactions with, awareness of, and attitudes, and feelings towards these new technologies, the development of new tools and communities around and against AI/ML, expansion of AI/ML education, and use of AI/ML in art and design or other domains outside "traditional AI/ML" spaces (e.g. engineering and computer science). 
>
> We increasingly interact with machine learning every day, whether it is through the way we access content through media providers such as Netflix, Twitter, and Instagram, or how we get from A to B on transit and vehicles. These increasingly algorithmically and data driven interactions do not come from the ether, but rather are the result of a complex and chaotic assemblage of social and technical forces.
>
> It is worth thinking about how the following factors affect or are affected by changes in AI/ML.

+ Research
+ Policies
+ Environment
+ Tools
+ Communities
+ Education
+ Art/Design



## Coding session

During this coding session, we will walk through several features of ml5.js. Specifically we will walk through the following features:

  * Example 1: image classifier
  * Example 2: PoseNet
  * Example 3: FaceApi
* Training your own model:
  * Example 4: Neural Network - json data / classification

## Terms

> Collected from [Yining's Week 1 of Machine Learning for the Web](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s0iT382Pl1DMGKb5xhk7_V3DlW1QQHfHs4snNoS_sIU/edit#slide=id.g40fd84b173_0_613)

- **Artificial Intelligence**:
  - AI is the science of making things smart:
  - Human Intelligence Exhibited by Machines
  - A broad term for getting computers to perform human tasks
  - **General AI**: fabulous machines that have all our senses (maybe even more), all our reason, and think just like we do.
  - Most of AI today is **Narrow AI** systems that can only do one (or a few) defined things as well or better than humans.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - One of the Approaches to Achieve Artificial Intelligence
  - A field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.
  - LOTS OF DATA
  - **Types of machine learning learning styles**:
    - **Supervised Learning**: 
      - Training data is labeled
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: 
      - The machine learn from an unlabelled data set.
      - Unsupervised learning can be grouped into clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    - **Reinforcement Learning**:
      - The machine learn by trial-and-error through reward or punishment.
  - **Types of machine learning outputs**:
    - **Regression**: Predict continuous values (price of a stock)
    - **Classification**: Predict a class/label (cat or dog?)
    - **Clustering**: Most similar other examples (Amazon related products recommendation)
    - **Sequence Prediction**: Predict the next word/sentence
  - **Types of machine learning use cases**:
    - Object Recognition
    - Speech and Sound Detection
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Prediction
    - Translation
- **Deep Learning**:
  - A technique for implementing Machine Learning
  - Deep learning - Uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy.
  - Can automatically learn representations/features from data such as images, video or text.
 
## The Machine Learning Process:

> The process of machine learning is messy. Like most data related projects, 80% of your time or more will be spent cleaning and preparing data for use. The rest of the time will be the actual "making" of your project. The machine learning process might be broadly (over)simplified into a handful of steps which includes: Data collection, data preparation, Training a machine learning model, and product/service integration.

* **Data collection**
  * E.g. an artist writes a script to automatically download all images of cats, dogs, and badgers from the internet. 
* **Data preparation**
  * E.g. the artist uses a crowd tasking service to 1. confirm that the image is either a cat, dog or badger, 2. Tag the image with the animal type, 3. Crop the image of the animal to a square aspect ratio. The artist then resizes all the images to 64x64px
* **Training a machine learning model**
  * E.g. the artist: 1. Uses a popular machine learning framework called Tensorflow in python to create a neural network. To create a neural network the artist, writes code that specifies image processing and data crunching methods that aim to pull out unique features for each animal type in the given images. The artist then 2. Iteratively refines and tests the model to achieve the highest accuracy.
* **Product/service integration...and awesome art projects**
  * E.g. the artist opensources this new pre-trained dog/cat/badger model. This comes just in time since the ASPCA in NYC has been in great need of a method to differentiate between the animals in their shelters. The artist is hired to create a web application that uses this model to label their shelter animals “cat”, or “dog” or “badger”.
